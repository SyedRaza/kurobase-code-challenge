# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   genres = Genre.create([{ title: 'Action' }, { title: 'Comedy' }, { title: 'Horror' }, { title: 'Animation' }, { title: 'Romance' }])
